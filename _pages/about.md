Hi, my name is Xutong Liu. I am now a postdoctoral researcher in [LIONS research group](https://research.ece.cmu.edu/lions/) at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. Carlee Joe-Wong](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cjoewong/). Previously, I was a visiting postdoc in [SOLAR Lab](https://solar.cs.umass.edu/people.html) at University of Massachusetts Amherst, advised by Prof. [Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/), and a postdoctoral fellow in [ANSR Lab](http://ansrlab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), advised by [Prof. John C.S. Lui](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/) (IEEE/ACM Fellow). 
I received my Ph.D. degree from the Computer Science and Engineering Department at CUHK in 2022, proudly advised by [Prof. John C.S. Lui](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/). Prior to that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree with an honored rank (top 5%) from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2017. 

**I am actively seeking faculty or research-focused positions starting in Fall 2025**. Here are my [CV (Dec, 2024)](https://mycuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/1155098137_link_cuhk_edu_hk/EVPKPmxle4tLhQMah5U4oxcBx7Jja9_4UOHfGhaHAnGxXA?e=yZtidj) and my [research statement](https://mycuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/1155098137_link_cuhk_edu_hk/ES7nMPd2c7lOoITOmw6LSrYBPO6GCKeP3AgQSKw9uOybkg?e=QoQfxI). 

I am also very excited to co-organize the 3rd Annual Workshop on Learning-Augmented Algorithms: Theory and Applications at ACM SIGMETRICS 2025, taking place in June at Stony Brook University, New York, USA. We warmly welcome posters/talks if you're interested. For more details, please visit the [official workshop website](https://learning-augmented-algorithms.github.io/). 

My Research
======
We live in an era defined by **intelligence** and **connectivity**. Intelligence or AI is like water. Computing and communication systems, such as data centers and communication networks, are like pipes, where intelligence can flow smoothly and freely across different platforms, devices, and users.

Just as well-designed plumbing systems ensure water reaches every corner with efficiency and reliability, I strive to develop **scalable and robust machine learning algorithms** to enhance the decision-making process in large-scale **AI computing and communication systems**. By doing so, I hope AI can be produced and distributed in a way that is accessible, adaptable, and reliable across diverse environments and use cases.

My research approach is around building **theoretical foundations** for online learning and reinforcement learning (RL)-based decision-making, and more importantly, making sure they can be readily translated into **real-world applications**. My recent focuses are:
