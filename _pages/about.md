Hi, my name is Xutong (James) Liu. I am now a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at the University of Washington, affiliated with the Department of Computer Science & Systems at the Tacoma School of Engineering & Technology. 
At UW, I am building the [**L**earning, **E**valuation, and **A**dvanced **D**ecision-making (**LEAD**)](https://xutongliu.me/group/) research lab and **<font color="red">actively recruiting Ph.D. students in Fall 2026</font>**, check [group information](https://xutongliu.me/group/) for details if you are interested in joining us.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in [LIONS research group](https://research.ece.cmu.edu/lions/) at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. Carlee Joe-Wong](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cjoewong/). Before that, I was a visiting postdoc in [SOLAR Lab](https://solar.cs.umass.edu/people.html) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, advised by Prof. [Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/), and a postdoctoral fellow in [ANSR Lab](http://ansrlab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), advised by [Prof. John C.S. Lui](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/) (IEEE/ACM Fellow). 
I received my Ph.D. degree from the Computer Science and Engineering Department at CUHK in 2022, proudly advised by [Prof. John C.S. Lui](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/). Prior to that, I received my bachelor‚Äôs degree with an honored rank (top 5%) from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2017. 




<!---I am also very excited to co-organize the 3rd Annual Workshop on Learning-Augmented Algorithms: Theory and Applications at ACM SIGMETRICS 2025, taking place in June at Stony Brook University, New York, USA. We warmly welcome posters/talks if you're interested. For more details, please visit the [official workshop website](https://learning-augmented-algorithms.github.io/).  -->

My Research
======
My research focuses on building **structure-aware online learning and reinforcement learning (RL)** algorithms that exploit the underlying **action, feedback, and agent structures** in networked systems (such as smoothness, sparsity, clustering) for optimal decision-making. I place a special emphasis on theory-grounded **data-efficiency, scalability, and robustness** guarantees of these algorithms, while also ensuring they can be readily applicable to **real-world decision-making problems in complex network environments**. My recent focuses are:
