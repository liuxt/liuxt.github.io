## Research Vision of our LEAD Research Lab
We live in an era defined by **intelligence** and **connectivity**. Artificial intelligence is the new "water" and "electricity". AI computing and communication systems, such as data centers, communication networks, and IoT systems, are like pipes and wires, enabling intelligence flow smoothly across different platforms, devices, and users.

Just as well-designed power grids ensure electricity reaches every corner of the world with efficiency and reliability, I strive to develop **scalable and robust machine learning algorithms** to make optimal decisions in **AI computing and communication systems**. By doing so, I hope AI can be produced and delivered in a way that is **accessible, adaptable, and reliable** across diverse environments and use cases.

## Student Recruitment
I am a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at the University of Washington (Tacoma campus, ~30 miles from the Seattle campus). I am recruiting **self-motivated PhD students (in 2026 fall), graduate researchers, and undergraduate interns (both in-person and remote)** for our **LEAD** research group (**L**earning, **E**valuation, and **A**dvanced **D**ecision-making), focusing on theory and/or application frontiers of **multi-agent reinforcement learning, combinatorial online learning, cost-effective LLM, and AI for networks**. 

Students will have opportunities to collaborate with leading researchers from **UW, CMU, UMass Amherst, Microsoft Research, and Adobe**, etc. I can recommend outstanding students for exchange visits to top schools or internships/jobs at top company research institutes.

Most of our previous/current collaborations would turn into publications in **top-tier venues/journals** (see examples below). 

If you're interested in joining us, please contact me with one-page research statement and your CV.
