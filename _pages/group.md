## **L**earning, **E**valuation, and **A**dvanced **D**ecision-making (LEAD) research group

I plan to recruit **self-motivated PhD students, graduate researchers, and undergraduate interns (both in-person and remote)** to build our **LEAD** (**L**earning, **E**valuation, and **A**dvanced **D**ecision-making) research group, focusing on theory and/or application frontiers of **reinforcement learning, online learning, cost-effective LLM, and AI for networks**. 

Students will have opportunities to collaborate with leading researchers from **UW, CMU, UMass Amherst, Microsoft Research, and Adobe**, etc. 

Most of our previous/current collaborations would turn into publications in **top-tier venues/journals** (see examples below). If you're interested, please contact me with your CV.
